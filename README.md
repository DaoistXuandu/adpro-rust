## Commit 1 Reflection notes
The handle_connection function in Rust processes an incoming TCP stream by reading HTTP request headers. It starts by creating a BufReader to efficiently handle stream data, then reads the request line by line using .lines(). The .map(|result| result.unwrap()) extracts the actual string, and .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty()) ensures only the headers are captured before collecting them into a Vec. Finally, it prints the request using println!("Request: {:#?}", http_request);, providing a structured debug output.

This function demonstrates efficient buffered reading and line-by-line parsing of an HTTP request. However, using .unwrap() can lead to panics if errors occur, so a more robust error-handling approach would be beneficial. The function is a foundational component of a basic HTTP server, helping to parse requests before processing and responding accordingly.
